The Pro plan is designed for teams and businesses. It allows you to create unlimited shortcuts and invite unlimited members. It also includes priority support. The Pro plan is $4 per month.

### Team

The Team plan is designed for teams that need more than the Pro plan. It allows you to use Single Sign-On(SSO) and other advanced features. If you need a team plan, please contact us at `yourselfhosted@gmail.com`.

3. You will see a form to enter your license key. Enter your license key and click the **Upload license** button.
4. If the license key is valid, your plan will be activated.

## FAQ

### Can I use the Free plan in my team?

Of course you can. In the free plan, you can invite up to 5 members to your team. If you need more, you should upgrade to the Pro plan.

### How many devices can the license key be used on?

It's unlimited for now, but please do not abuse it.

### Can I get a refund if Slash doesn't meet my needs?

Yes, absolutely! You can contact us with `yourselfhosted@gmail.com`. I will refund you as soon as possible.

### Is there a Lifetime license?

As software requires someone to maintain it, so we won't sell a lifetime service, since humans are not immortal yet. But if you really want it, please contact us `yourselfhosted@gmail.com`.
