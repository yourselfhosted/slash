# Monotreme Collections

**Monotreme Collections** introduces a feature to help you better organize and manage related Shortcuts.

## What is a Collection?

A Collection is like a virtual folder where you can group and organize your related Shortcuts. It acts as a container that holds Shortcuts together for a specific purpose or theme. Let's break down the key attributes:

- **Name:** Your chosen label for the Collection. This becomes a crucial part of the URL, enabling direct and quick access to the Collection. For example, if your Collection is named "work-projects", the direct access link would be `c/work-projects`. This user-defined name significantly enhances the accessibility and recognition of your Collections.
- **Title:** A brief title summarizing the Collection's content.
- **Description:** A short description explaining what the Collection is about.
- **Shortcuts:** The Shortcuts included in the Collection.
- **Visibility:** Settings to control who can access the Collection.

## What Problems Does It Solve?

Monotreme Collections tackle the challenge of efficiently managing and organizing related Shortcuts. By grouping Shortcuts into Collections, you can create a more structured and accessible workflow. This makes it easier to find, access, and share information based on specific themes or projects.
