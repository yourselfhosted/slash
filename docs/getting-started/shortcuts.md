# Monotreme Shortcuts

**Monotreme Shortcuts** is a handy tool designed to make handling and sharing links in your digital workspace a breeze.

## What is a Shortcut?

A Shortcut is a simplified version of a link with essential details, making it easy to remember, organize, and share. Let's break down the key elements:

- **Name:** Your chosen label for the Shortcut. This becomes a crucial part of the URL, enabling direct and quick access to the Shortcut.

- **Link:** The original web link you want to streamline.
- **Title:** A quick overview of what's behind the link.
